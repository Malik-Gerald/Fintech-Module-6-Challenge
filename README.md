# Qantitative Analysis Of Select Portfolios

The fourth module asks that I assume the role of a financial analyst for a FinTech investing platform. In this exercise we have leveraged Pandas to evaluate the performance, volatility, risk, risk-return profile and portfolio diversification in order to make a judgement on which portfolio product would be best to offer to our clients. 

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.9.7 ((default, Sep 16 2021, 16:59:28) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32) with the following packages:
 
 * [jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/urls.html#managing-workspaces-ui) - For information about the jupyter lab remote workspace hosted by a local computer.
 
* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#module-pathlib) - For the command line interface, help page, and entry-point.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) - Matplotlib 3.5.1 documentation
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. 

* [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.0/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) - Matplotlib 3.5.1 documentation. 
matplotlib.pyplot is a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides an implicit, MATLAB-like, way of plotting. It also opens figures on your screen, and acts as the figure GUI manager.

* [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - Source repository. 
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
